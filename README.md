# Advent of Code 2018
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code advent calendar of 2018.
Unfortunately I have not keept the answers for most of the first parts. Since I just 
rewrote the code in the same file in a very destructive manner. And I wouldn't say
this is the best code I've written, most of it was written very hastely to my own 
detrement.

## Running
I have my inputs in the folder labeld so. But the programs run are usually hardcoded 
for certain file-names, so running them is a bit of a hoop to run through.
